                    <header>CPU and CPU Cooler</header>
                    <p>AMD or Intel?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Intel in the past has dominated the CPU market, but with AMD's Ryzen CPU lineup, they have been going toe-to-toe, if not outperforming similar Intel CPU's</li>
                        <li>Both offer a wide variety of budget, mid-range, and high performing CPU's</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Processor Speed</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Depending on your budget and the range of CPU you are looking for, your speed will differ</li>
                        <li>Depending on what you are going to be using your computer for, I would say to try and get a least a minimum of 2.0 - 2.5ghz processor speed. Some CPU's offer a feature called overclocking, which allows you to boost the speed of your CPU up to a certain point, but doing so will void your manufacturer warranty. I would suggest doing research before performing this tasks and make sure your CPU is capable of overlcocking</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Cores/Threads</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Different ranges of CPU's offer different core counts</li>
                        <li>The better the performance, the more cores that CPU will likely have</li>
                        <li>Cores help your computer run smoother and faster when you are multitasking and have multiple tabs or windowns open across your computer</li>
                        <li>If you are looking for video streaming/editing, I would look to get a CPU with more cores to help keep up with those demands of the editing software's</li>
                        <li>If you a using your computer for just light personal use and light gaming, I would aim for a CPU with at least 2-4 cores, that should suffice</li>

                    <p>Micro ATX vs ATX</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Micro ATX is a smaller version of the standard size ATX motherboard (these are just the size refernces for motherboards)</li>
                            <li>If you aren't going all out for parts and are putting just some basic parts without plans of upgrading soon, a Micro ATX would work just find and save you some money upfront</li>
                            <li>Micro typically limit the amount of Graphic Card and RAM slots you have available to use (typically 2 RAM slots and 1 Graphic Card slot on the Micro vs 4 RAM slots and at least 2 Graphic Card slots on the standard ATX size)</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>AMD vs Intel compatibility</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Some Motherboard are only specifically designed to work with either AMD or Intel CPU's. If you usepcpartpicker.com, they do a great job in automatically sorting these for you once you have your CPU picked out</li>

                    <p>RAM and VGU Slots</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mini-ATX Motherboards often find themselves with less VGU (Graphics Card) slots and less RAM slots. On a normal motherboard, you may find 4 Ram slots and 2 VGU slots. On a Mini-ATX you may only have 2 RAM slots and 1 VGU slot</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>DDR4 vs DDR5</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>DDR4 and DDR5 are just the lastest model of memory available (DDR4 came out in 2016 and DDR5 is expected to come out later in 2022). Think of these as version controls, with DDR5 expected to be better with memory speeds and having larger memory with improvement of technology compared to DDR4</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>RAM Speeds</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There are different speeds of RAM depending on what you are building a PC for. The typical speeds range from DDR4-1600 to DDR4-3200. The speeds to just help how quickly your RAM runs. If you are building a budget computer/budget gaming computer, you can get away with DDR4-1600 or DDR4-2400</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>How Much RAM (GB)?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How much RAM you have is more important (in my opinion) than the speed of your RAM. With computer creating larger files, the more RAM you have, the better your computer will be able to run. For any computer you are building, I would recommend getting at least 16GB worth of RAM to handle your work load. Depending on what you are using your computer for (like video editing and photoshop applications), it might be worth while to get 32GB, 48GB or even 64GB of RAM to help your computer process those programs</li>

                    <p>VRAM</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Similar to RAM, VRAM is the memory available of a Graphics Card. The lowest you will typically find is 4GB on budget Graphic Cards (some have as low as 3GB). Depending what you are gaming (assuming you will be gaming if you are purchasing a Graphics Card), I would recommend aiming for at lesat 4GB if you aren't playing graphic intense games. If you are, I would recommend getting a Graphics Card with at least 6-8GB of VRAM to help run those more graphic intense games</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>AMD vs Nvidia</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Similar to CPU's, AMD and Nvidia are the two biggest Graphics Card manufacturer's. Nvidia, similar to Intel, use to dominate this field. Lately, AMD has made a big improvement on their Graphic Cards, going more toe-to-toe with Nvidia, while also offering more affordable Graphic Cards. AMD has had some driver issues since their latest line of RX cards came out. Most seem to be fixed, but people still report having driver issues here and there. Nvidia has very stable drivers that are being updated constantly, but as mentioned earlier, they tend to be marked up higher than the AMD cards</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Series and Performance</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Both compaines has a line of Graphic Cards with different performance's throughout the line. AMD currently has their line of RX 6000 series cards starting with the RX 6700 up to the RX 6900 XT with the RX 6900 XT being the most powerful and expensive and the RX 6700 being the least powerful (for this lineup, but still a good Graphics Card) but the most affordable. Nvidia has the latest series of RTX 30 series ranging from the RTX 3050 to the RTX 3090 Ti with the 3090 Ti being the most expensive and the most powerful, and the RTX 3050 being the most affordable but least powerful in the lineup. Both have older lineups you can shop for, as well as more budget friendly series as well, but for this page, I will just explain their main series as these have the highest market shares</li>

                    <p>Wattage</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Depending on how strong of components and how many peripherals you'll connect to your computer, will depend on what wattage you want. They range from as low as 200 watts to as high as 1800 watts. If you are building a more modern computer with more mid level components, I would recommend getting around 750 watts as this is the sweet spot for power supply level around that range. If you ar building a more high end computer with more powerful components, I would recommend getting around 1000 watts possibly even 1200. If you are building your PC and its parts through pcpartpicker.com, at the bottom it will give you the wattage output of all your components combined, so this will help you choose how much wattage you need for your power supply. If you aren't using pcpartpicker.com (which I recommend you do to avoid buying non-compatable parts) I would keep track of what the wattage output is of each component to help determine what wattage you will need</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Plus/Bronze/Silver/Gold/Platinum</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Similar to other components, power supplies have different perforamnce ratings for power supplies. There is 80 Plus, Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum with Plus being the least efficient and Platinum being the most efficient with max load to the power supply. Most users can get away with 80 Plus or Bronze, but if you see a good deal on a Silver or Gold I would go for it. Starting with Plus and working up to Platinum will also increase the price of the power supply since it becomes more efficient with each rating</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Non-Modular vs Semi-Modular vs Fully Modular</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Non-Modular power supplies have all cable connections permanently connected with no option to swap them out. Semi-Modular has some cables permanently connected with the option to customize some cables. Fully Modular has no cables pre attached and allows you to connect just the cables you need and also allows you to customize all your cables if you are going for a theme with your computer. Fully Modular will allow you to have better cable management as well with Non-Modular having the worst cable managment</li>

                    <header>Storage</header>
                    <p>SSD vs HDD</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>HDD (Hard Drive Disk) are your standard hard drives that have been around for a long time. These typically are more cost effective than SSD's and have more storage with a lower price than that of an SSD with an equivilant storage capacity. SSD's are smaller and more compact. SSD (Solid State Drive) are significantly faster with load times compared to HDD's. With SSD's being faster they are more expensive than a HDD (1TB HDD is roughly $40-$50 and a 1TB SSD is around $100-$110 depending on manufacturer). If you aren't storing a ton of data on your computer, you could easily get away with a 500GB SSD to have plenty of storage and fast load times</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>m.2 Sticks</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>M.2 Sticks are a variation of SSD's. They are even smaller SSD's that plug directly into the Motherboard (if compatiable) and because of this, they don't need cables from the power supply, so better for cable management. These M.2 are even faster than a standard Sata SSD (SATA is the cable connection for standard HDD and SSD to power supply) and because of this, are more expenisve than a normal SSD (1TB M.2 is usually around $120-$150 vs $100-$110 for 1TB SSD). If you aren't storing a lot of data or playing demanding games to improve load times, I would stick with just a HDD or normal SSD</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Multiple and External</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Many people opt to have many storage devices. Myself, I have a 500GB SSD that I have windows installed on to help with the load times of my PC and a 2TB HDD with another 256GB SSD. Some people also opt to get external hard drives. This can be a great choice to back up all your files in case your computer crashes or gets hacked or to move files you want to keep, but don't have the storage on your current PC/setup. These typically come in at 1TB of storage and can be found for around $50-$100</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                <section class="main-section" id="Case">
                    <header>Case</header>
                    <p>Size</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There are different size cases believe it or not. There are ATX Mini, Mid, and Full tower's. The Mini is a great option if you are looking to build a compact PC that doesn't take up a lot of space and will perfectly hold a Mini-ATX Motherboard, but not a full size Motherboard. Mid is your standard size case that the majority of people use that should fit everything you need. A Full tower will be geared towards someone who is looking to have mutiple Graphic Cards (3+), lots of storage, and more often than not customer water cooling as well. This allows for more space to hold all the additional parts you have. If you are building a pretty standard set up with 1 Graphics Card and 1-3 storage devices, a Mid tower will suite you just fine, in my opinion</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Cooling Features</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Different cases have different designes with natural air flow and space for case fans to help cool your PC (some also come with RGB lights). Air flow is an important part for a case as this will help prevent your PC and its components from overheating. Most modern cases are designed to have good air flow and come standard with typically one rear fan (blow warm/hot air out) and 2 front fans (draw cool air in). I would check the product description of the case you're interested in to see what is included. You can also buy additional fans for your case (including ones with RGB) or even install water coolers (I'll get to them later). If you aren't buying high end compoenents (or mutiple components such as Graphics Cards) or running programs/games/applications that are highly demanding that will force your parts to run near max capacity, just a few (3-5) standard case fans will suffice</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Panel</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Some cases come with side panels to see into your PC. If you are someone who enjoys the aesthetics of your PC (cable managmenet, RGB lights, etc) or are just proud of what you built and like to see what is in side, I would recommend a case with a side panel. There are 2 types of side panels, Acyrlic and Tempered. Acrylic is generally the more budget friendly option but can scratch easily. Tempered is more heavy duty and scratch resitant. They are also more visually appealing (IMO). Either really works, this comes down to more of a personal preference</li>

                    <p>Water Coolers</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Water coolers are a type of cooling system for computers. They are a little more complicated and advanced than normal case fans. Because of this, they are uslally a lot more expensive. Being pretty self explanatory, a water cooler is a cooling system that cirulates water through a hose or tubes to cool specific components (such as a CPU) and that water is then cooled by fans. Some people create customer water cooling systems that look amazing. If you just want a standard CPU water cooler, I would recomment that or if you are uncomfortable with that, just sticking with case fans is also completely fine</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Monitor(s)</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Monitors range from having different resolutions (1920 x 1080p is standard HD and 3840 x 2160 is 4K), different refresh rates (60hz vs 240hz), different displays (IPS vs OLED), and different styles (Standard vs Curved vs Ultra Wide). This is totally up to you on what monitor you want to get. If you are playing FPS games, you would benefit from having a higher refresh rate (144hz would be just fine). If you are playing high graphic intense games, you might want to lean towards more of a 4K resoltuion. At the end of the day, find the monitor that best suits your needs and what you will be using you PC for</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Mouse/Keyboard</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Again, this is totally up to you at the end of the day. Some people prefer keyboard/mouse setups to have RGB lights. Others might prefer a wireless setup to elimiate those cables. If you aren't a pro gamer or ranked highly in popular competitive games, you don't need to spend a whole lot on a keyboard/mouse set up, just find something you like the look of and how it feels</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Headset/Speakers</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A lot of monitors don't have built in speakers, so a lot of people will decide to get speakers to connect, so they don't always have to wear their headsets. Other's will prefer to just wear their headsets. Speaking of headsets, there is a good range of some to choose from, but this doesn't have to break the bank either. There are choices of wired and wireless and some have RGB. Most headsets will do the job, so find something you like and if you are happy with the reviews, I would say go for that one</li>

                    <p>Bottlenecking</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bottlenecking is the condition is which one component limits the performance of other components due to capability issues. Most often you will see this between the CPU and the Graphics Card. Make sure you aren't choosing a CPU that is way more powerful than your Graphics Card and vice versa, this will help eliminate this issue. If you are building a mid level/mid budget PC ($1000 - $1500), try to stay within those mid level components and the same applies for low level/budget and high level/budget</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Compatibility of Monitor with Graphics Card</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This will have a similar effect of Bottlenecking if your Graphics Card is more powerful than your monitor. If you are getting a more powerful Graphics Card, try and find a higher level monitor (144hz refresh rate or higher and 1440p resoltuion or higher). This will help so that your monitor doesn't limit the performance of your Graphics Card and this way you can also fully utilize the performance of that Graphics Card with that monitor</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Windows Key</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This is something that often gets over looked. If you don't have a Windows key to use to get a legitimate copy of Windows, I highly suggest it. The nice part is, you don't have to worry about spending $100+ on a Windows product key from Microsoft. You can get Windows key's on eBay for $5 that work just fine. I have done this a few times and I haven't had any issues. You will need to store a backup of Windows onto a USB to install it first, then purchase the key after. Paul's Hardware YouTube channel has a great video for how to do this. I will post a copy of the link <a class='youtube' href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXTqz3Fd28M&t=434s">here</a>

                    <header>Building Steps</header>
                    <p>IMPORTANT</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make sure to ground yourself periodically to make sure you don't accidentailly shock your PC parts and ruin them before you get to use them! Best practice is to open up your power supply and connect it to the cable and then plug it into the wall, but don't turn it on. This will help eliminate any built up static shock in your body. Alternatively, you can buy Anti-Static mats that you can work on that will help keep your grounded while you work via a wrist strap the is connected to you and the mart. It is also good practice to build your PC in an area where there isn't any carpet to help avoid this as well</li>
                        <li>If any any point you are lost or are struggling, consult the manuals that came with your parts as they will typically have directions of how to install those parts correctly. If that doesn't work you can always look up videos online to help with what you are specifically struggling with</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Tools</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The only tools you'll need that aren't included with your parts will be a philips head screwdriver</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Motherboard</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Start by removing your motherboard from its packaging. We will start to attach some components to the Motherboard before installing it in the case. There should be an IO shield included with your Motherboard. Put this to the side for now, we will need this when we install the Motherboard into the case. There will also be a set of screws (roughly 8, some may have more or less depending on the size), put these to the side as well as these will be used to secure the Motherboard into the case</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>CPU</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Remove the CPU and the stock cooler from the packaging. Lift the little lever in the CPU spot on the Motherboard to install the CPU. Find the gold triangle located on the CPU and match that up with the similar shape and color on the Motherboard to install the CPU correctly. Make sure you don't touch the gold prongs on the CPU! Once you have the CPU installed correctly with the trianlge on the CPU lined up with the triangle on the Motherboard and the CPU is sitting snug in it's slot, go ahead and pull down on the lever to secure the CPU into place in the Motherboard (Note: Some Motherboards have a plastic piece that will pop off once you close the lever on the CPU, this is normal and that piece is suppose to pop off. If it doesn't pop off, make sure the CPU is installed correctly)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>CPU Cooler</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Once the CPU is installed correctly we can move on to the CPU Cooler. This process should be the same whether you are installing the stock CPU Cooler or an aftermarket CPU Cooler. Locate the thermal paste that came with your cooler. This paste will help transfer the cool air from the cooler to the CPU. Apply a pea size amount of paste directly to the CPU (The paste spreads a lot, so don't put much more than a pea size amount!!) There should be a bracket for the cooler already attached to the stock CPU cooler. If you have an aftermarket CPU cooler, follow the directions that came with it to install that bracket and CPU (These steps might differ between Intel and AMD CPU's so make sure you follow the right steps and have the right bracket!). Locate the four holes around the outside of where the CPU is and place the bracket and the cooler in. Make sure everything is aligned properly and if so, secure the bracket into place, which will also secure the CPU cooler against the CPU. If any excess thermal paste came out, make sure to wipe that up before continuing. To get power to the cooler, take the plug and locate the CPU Fan pin on the Motherboard and attach the cable to those pins</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>RAM</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Locate the 4 (or 2 depending on your Motherboard) RAM slots. These should be to the left of the CPU. Pull back the tabs on the RAM slots to place your RAM in. If you are installing 2 sticks of RAM into a Motherboard with 4 slots, install the first stick in the first slot and the second stick in the 3rd slot (or 2nd slot and 4th slot). This will allow your Motherboard to access it's dual-channel capabilites (RAM will be able to perform to it's potential this way). If you have 2 sticks with 2 slots or 4 sticks with 4 slots, just install all the RAM into the available slots as this will not be a concern. If you have just one stick, you can place it in any available spot, but it is recommended to just place it in the first slot. To install the RAM, line the teeth on the bottom of them to the slot in the Motherboard. Line the outside of the RAM with where the tabs are located and push into place. If done correctly, the RAM sticks should click into place and the tabs should automatically lock the RAM sticks in place when you push them in. If this didn't work, assure you are installing the RAM sticks the correct way and that the stick is level when you are pushing it into place</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Graphics Card</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Graphics Card will be installed in a similar fashion to the RAM. Open up the tab for the PCI-E slot (Generally found underneath the CPU running horizontally). The fans(s) on your Graphics Card should be facing down to ensure correct installation. Make sure the teeth are lined up properly to the slot and push the Graphics Card into place. Like the RAM slots, if installed correctly, the tab should pop down and lock the Graphics Card into place in the PCI-E slot (If you have multiple Cards, repeat this process)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Install to Case</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You are now ready to install the Motherboard into your case. Unbox you case and open it so the side panel is open (Should be the side with the window pane). Lay your case flat on the opposite side of the side you are installing your Motherboard on. There should be roughly 8 screw that will hold your Motherboard in place to the case. Align the Motherboard over these holes to screw in. Before you screw you Motherboard into place, make sure you grab the IO shield that came with the Motherboard and to unscrew the brackets at the back of the case where your Graphics Card will sit and slide in the case</li>
                        <li>Take your IO shield, and line it up with the corresponding spot on the case. Put your Motherboard into place. If aligned correctly, the Graphics Card should slide right into the slot at the back of the case. The ports for your Motherboard should be aligned and fitted snug to the IO shield. You may need to play around with the IO shield to get it to sit and match up with the Motherboard. If you need to uninstall the Graphics Card to help achieve this, simply pull the tab back on the PCI-E slot and carefully pull the Graphics Card out with even distribution and it should come out. Once you get the IO fitting right, you can put the Graphics Card back in. Now locate those 8 holes on the Motherboard and screw in the 8 screws that came with your Motherboard into those spots to secure your Motherboard in place with the case</li>
                        <li>Once all the screws are secured properly into place, slowly lift your case upright. If everything is installed correctly, nothing should fall or be loose. If any parts do fall or come loose, lay the case back down and redo those steps for those parts to make sure they are installed correctly</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Storage</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Next, find the spots in your case for you storage (You might need to take off the other panel on your case as well to access these depending on the case). Your HDD should be installed in the larger spots of similar size and your SSD should be in the smaller spots of similar size. Some cases are designed to have slots hold both, see what your case supports. If you are unsure where your storage spots are at, find the manual of your case and it should help provide all the information of where you need to install certain parts and follow those directions</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Power Supply</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You are now ready to install the Power Supply. Locate the power supply bracket at the bottom of the back of the case if you have it standing upright. There should be some thumbscrews attached, simply unscrew those screws, place the power supply with the fan down in that spot and reattach that bracket with the power supply. The thumbscrews should line up with holes in the power supply to hold your power supply into place</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Cable Management</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>All the connections you should need to find should be labled out on the manual of your Motherboard. This should help you locate all the connections you will need to have for your power supply and PC components!</li>
                        <li>You are now ready to attach your power supply cables to your PC components! The biggest cable should be your 24 pin connector for the Motherboard. This should be located on the right side of the Motherboard. Attach this cable to that connector. There should be a 4+$ pin cable for the CPU. The pins for this connection are typically towards the bottom of the Motherboard or the top. Located those pins and connect the CPU cable to those pins. There should also be a 4 pin connection for the supply itself. Locate this and connect that cable to those corresponding pins. Next find your VGA/PCI-E cable, this will get power to your Graphics Card. Locate the opening on your Graphcis Card and attach this cable into that spot, this is traditionally a 6/8 pin connection. Next locate your SATA cables, these will be the connections for your storage drives. Connect as many SATA cables as you have hard drives to your corresponding hard drives. After everything is all connected and ready to go, you should be good to boot up your computer!</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Make sure your video connection to your monitor is from the Graphics Card. My first time building a PC I accidentally hooked it up to my motherboard, so I wasn't getting an image. This caused me to freak out a bit thinking I messed something up, but it was really just a mistake in my connections</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Make sure you have at least your Mouse and Keyboard plugged into their USB ports to properly navigate. I would worry about extras, such as speakers, later after everything else is set up</li>
                    </ul>
                    <code>BIOS</code>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When you first boot up, since you won't have Windows installed yet, your PC should boot into the BIOS of your motherboard. Get familiar with where certain items are located within you motherboard, as any overclocking you might do will be done from within your BIOS (consult your motherboard's manual or google your specific motherboard before overclocking)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <code>Windows Setup</code>
                    <ul>
